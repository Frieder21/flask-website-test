# while alive

It started with a Reddit post of mine where I changed a "hacker/coder" background and uploaded it as a meme on r/egg_irl. I got so many good comments and suggestions that I started designing this background from scratch as a web background. I want this background to be super easy to change when the project is done, even for people who can't code. This background can then be used as a live background with the Wallpaper Engine, for example. At the moment I'm so far that you can change the background very easily by a small change in JavaScript.
