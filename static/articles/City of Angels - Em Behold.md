# City of Angels - Em Behold

```song
[Verse 1]
It's [C#m]hard havin' a [G#7]heart in the [A]city [E]
Look at the [C#m]stars, waiting for [G#]someone
to tell you you're [A]pretty; you're [E]enough
So it [C#m]goes, I don't [G#]know,
what the [A]feeling's like to be [E]comfortable
With a [C#m]stranger in your [G#]skin
Don't know [A]why you let them [E]in


[Chorus] 
[C#m]We used to talk about the fakers in LA
[G#]But now you're one of 'em and damn it hurts to say
[A]I should have seen it comin' from a mile [E]away,
a mile [idk]away
[C#m]You always wanted to take before you give
[G#]But what's the fun of it
I don't know how you [A]live with yourself
in your Hollywood house in the [E]hills
Gives me [G#7]chills
City of [C#m]angels 


[Interlude]
[C#m]______ [G#]_______ [A]______ [E]______


[Verse 2]
Used to [C#m]say, if you ever [G#]made it
I'd be the [A]first call [E]
And life would [C#m]stay fairly the [G#]same
Oh our [A]friendship wouldn't [E]change at all
But you [C#m]busted haven't [G#]talked in a year
I mi[A]strusted, now it's [E]all coming clear
That you [G#7]only think of yourself
May be [E]loved, but you're lonely as [G#]hell, oh


[Chorus]
[C#m]We used to talk about the fakers in LA
[G#]But now you're one of 'em, I guess you got your way
[A]I bet you're tired of all the games you had to [E]play,
you had to [idk]play
[C#m]You always wanted to take before you give
[G#]But what's the fun of it
I don't know how you [A]live
with yourself in your Hollywood house in the [E]hills
Gives me [G#7]chills


[Bridge]
City of [A]angels
Thats what they [G#]call us, right? [G#7]
Wish you were [C#m]able
To see there's [E]so much more to life
Than [A]fortune and fame, validation and pain
When you [G#]always want more,[G#7] there's nothing to [C#m]gain [E]


[Chorus]
[C#m]We used to talk about the fakers in LA
[B#]But now you're one of 'em and damn it hurts to say 
[A]Damn it hurts to say[E] 
[C#m]You always wanted to take before you give
[G#]But what's the fun of it
I don't know how you [A]live
with yourself in your Hollywood house in the [E]hills    
Gives me [G#7]chills


[Outro]
City of [A]angels
Thats what they [G#]call us, right? [G#7]
Wish you were [C#m]able
To see there's [E]so much more to life
City of [A]angels
That's what they [G#]call us, right? [G#7]
City of [C#m]angels [E]______ [A]______
