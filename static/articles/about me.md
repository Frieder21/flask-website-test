#About Me

My name is Frieda, and I'm from Germany. I'm currently in school, and I love programming and art. I'm not exactly sure what inspired me to get into programming, but I've always enjoyed it. In the future, I hope to become better at both programming and drawing.

Outside of school and hobbies, I'm also involved in activism. I'm trans and use she/they pronouns, and I often attend demonstrations for a better world, such as against climate change, for pride, and against fascist opinions.
